# What is Gazebo?

Gazebo is an open-source 3D robotics simulator that provides the ability to simulate complex robotic environments and interactions with high-fidelity physics. It allows developers to test and visualize robot behavior in virtual environments, including sensor data simulation, object interactions, and environmental dynamics. Gazebo is widely used in the robotics community because of its realistic physics engine, ease of use, and integration with other robotic tools like ROS.

## How Gazebo works

Gazebo uses a physics engine to simulate the dynamics of a robot within a 3D world, including aspects like gravity, collisions, and friction. It also supports a variety of sensors, including cameras, laser scanners, and IMUs, which can be used to mimic real-world sensory feedback. Developers can create and modify simulation worlds using tools like the Gazebo GUI or by importing models from other software like Blender.

Gazebo integrates seamlessly with ROS, enabling the simulation of hardware, sensors, and actuators in a virtual environment while communicating with ROS nodes. In this setup, ROS nodes can control the simulated robot and process the data coming from the simulated sensors. This real-time feedback loop provides a powerful tool for testing and validating robotic software without needing to use physical hardware.

## Why we are using Gazebo

We are using Gazebo in our project because it allows us to simulate the physical world and interactions of the robot in a virtual environment. Gazebo provides accurate physics simulation, enabling us to test the robotâ€™s behavior, sensor inputs, and interactions with the environment before deploying the software on real hardware. Through its integration with ROS, Gazebo also helps us to bridge the communication between the emulated hardware (via QEMU) and the virtual environment, ensuring the robot's virtual and physical systems work together effectively.
